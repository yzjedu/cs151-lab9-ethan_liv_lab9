1. Get File Name from the User
- Purpose: To prompt the user to enter the file name that contains the list of attendees. 
- Name: get_filename 
- Parameters: None 
- Return: A file name, represented by a string. 
- Algorithm:
  1. Prompt the user to enter the filename. 
  1. Read the input from the user. 
  1. Return the file name that was entered. 

2. Read Names from File into a List
- Purpose: To read names from the specified file and store them in a list.
- Name: read_names_file
- Parameters: filename - a string representing the name of the file.
- Return: A list of names (each element is a string from the file).
- Algorithm:
  1. Open the file using the given filename. 
  2. Read each line in the file and strip any whitespace. 
  3. Append each cleaned name to a list. 
  4. Close the file. 
  5. Return the list of names. 

3. Format and Display the Seating Arrangement
- Purpose: To format and display the seating arrangement based on tables and seats. 
- Name: format_display_seat 
- Parameters: names - a list of attendee names.

     3. For each table:
     - Print the table number. 
     - Loop through each name (up to five per table), displaying the seat number and guestâ€™s name. 
     - Ensure output is formatted to include table and seat number.
  
4. Main Function
- Purpose: To control the flow of the program.
