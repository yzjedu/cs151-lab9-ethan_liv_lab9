Objective
In this lab, the objective was to learn how to manage file input/output, use lists and loops, and format data for display by organizing seating arrangements for a dinner party. We were supposed to write a program that reads names from a file, determines the number of tables required, and then outputs seating assignments in a structured format.
Procedure
1. Planned with an Algorithm and Design: Liv and I collaborated to develop the algorithm, which helped us structure the functions and overall program flow.
2. Used Test Cases to Test: I created various test cases, including edge cases like empty files and files with names in exact multiples of five, to verify the program’s behavior.
3. Coded to Implement: I completed the coding, translating the algorithm into functions and handling all specified output formatting.
Results
The results matched what I expected. Testing confirmed that the program printed the correct number of tables and assigned names as expected, even in edge cases.
Reflection
Challenges: One challenge was ensuring that the program didn’t attempt to display seat assignments if the file was empty or missing. This was resolved by checking if the list of names was non-empty before formatting the seating arrangement. Another challenge was organizing the program flow logically so each function had a clear role.
Programming Rules:
1. Identify the Problem: The main problem was organizing data for a dinner party and ensuring each guest was assigned a specific seat and table.
2. Design and Plan: Liv and I collaborated on the algorithm, which helped establish a clear structure for each function’s purpose.
3. Execute and Test: I completed the program and used test cases to confirm functionality across different file scenarios, ensuring accuracy and robustness.
Takeaways: I believe I learned what I was supposed to, including file handling, organizing data with lists, and formatting output. Working with Liv was productive; collaborating on the algorithm helped us create a solid foundation, and then I completed the program.
